## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Aggregate Telemetry Processor is a Kafka Processor API that aggregates telemetry data to one minute, fifteen minutes, and one hour.

- The Heartbeat Telemetry Processor sends an output topic, dcentriq.aggregation.active_telem.json.
- The Aggregate Telemetry Processor will aggregate the data from the dcentriq.aggregation.active_telem.json into:
- one minute aggregation: dcentriq.aggregation.one_minute_telem.json
- fifteen minute aggregation: dcentriq.aggregation.fifteen_minute_telem.json
- one hour aggregation: dcentriq.aggregation.one_hour_telem.json

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

- Clone the dcentriq-process-common project.
- Clone the dcentriq-aggregate-telemetry-processor project.
- mvn clean install
